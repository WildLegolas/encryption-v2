# encryption-v2
run the application, and install to desktop when prompted, open carmack_experience_v2, everything else is just dependencies

this program translates any message into an encrypted message consisting of chinese characters,
but only reads as gibberish to anyone who can actually read chinese

10,000 characters are used, meaning the number of permutations is much higher than an alphanumeric encrypter

to translate back, the user on the other end must have the correct seed or it will not work

to set the seed, type in the seed into the left text box and press "showtime", then clear

now translate any message to or from the encrypted version with entries on the left and output on the right text box,
making sure to clear after every entry as translation takes in everything in the left text box, not just newest line

available input languages, are english, german, spanish, french, russian, and greek, along with special characters

space is included as chinese does not use spaces and this encryption seeks to blend in to any non-speakers as normal chinese text

only \ is excluded from translation
